# job-management-fe
Front end developed in VueJS 2.0 with Vuetify plugin.


Job Management is a small open-source project, without commercial intends.

The main purposes of this project is practicing my knowledge of web application development acquired in the last years, to help me organize my search for new job opportunities and also help many friends who are also looking for a new job.

The project duration is about 4 months and I believe it is about 70% complete.

If you would like to contribute to improving this application, please contact me:
